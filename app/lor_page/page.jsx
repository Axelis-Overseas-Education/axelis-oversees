            Whenever someone is looking to attain an academic qualification or
            trying to apply for a job at a prestigious organization, they
            generally need to submit one or more Letters of Recommendation (LOR)
            to help the assessment committee understand whether they are a
            suitable fit for the course or work profile. A LOR is usually
            written by a previous employer or a professor who knows the person
            well enough to become a referee and suggests the organization
            shortlist the prospective candidate. This blog aims to provide you
            with a comprehensive guide on the central aspects of a letter of
            recommendation, LOR formats and the major things you need to keep in
            mind while writing one.

          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Types of LOR</h2>
          <p>
            Most of us might not know about it but, there are two types of
            Letters of Recommendation. This distinction between them is made on
            the basis of the nature of the provider or recommender. Let us go
            through and understand the two types of LOR.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>Academic LOR</h3>
          <p>
            The Letter of recommendation that is provided by a faculty member
            belonging to an academic institution that you have previously
            studied at can be referred to as an academic LOR. Universities
            abroad demand at least one academic LOR. In such cases, you can
            refer to your previous academic institution for this help. This type
            of LOR open highlights the student’s ability to pursue that course
            as it aligned with their prior accomplishments.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>Professional LOR</h3>
          <p>
            The majority of the universities abroad ask for prior work
            experience, especially during master’s admission. Professional LOR
            can be provided by your senior or a colleague belonging to your last
            organisation. Students must know that it is necessary that the
            professional LOR is stated on the letterhead. Professional LOR
            focuses on determining the candidate’s ability to work in diverse
            environments, and{" "}

            and cites their exposure regarding the domain.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Who Needs LOR and Why?&nbsp;</h2>
          <p>
            All those who are looking forward to pursuing higher education will
            mandatorily need LORs, especially those who are planning to{" "}

                study abroad
              </a>
            </strong>
            . Regardless of the study level, course and field of study; students
            usually require 2 LORs belonging to academic as well as professional
            backgrounds. Many times, students enrolling in UG-level courses do
            not have prior work experience; thus, they can request a LOR from
            school teachers, institute teachers, professors, counselors etc.
            Whereas those who are all said to pursue a masters abroad, they can
            avail their LOR from the last employer, internship manager, college
            professors and so on.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>LOR Formats</h2>
          <p>
            The letters of recommendation are usually spread across 4 to 5
            paragraphs which thoroughly describe candidates’ ability for
            upcoming endeavors. Each paragraph is usually devoted to a
            particular section that delivers the required information about the
            individual. Letters understand the basic structure of a LOR through
            these LOR formats.

            The first paragraph establishes the nature of the association
            between the student and the recommender. It is usually begun by
            stating the professional designation along with the individual’s
            education and can be concluded by subtly mentioning why the
            recommender is happy to share the reference.&nbsp;

          <p>
            A Letter of Recommendation (LOR) holds extreme importance for a
            candidate who has applied for a course or a job profile. The
            assessment committee allotted to determine the worthiness of a
            candidate haven’t met them in person or have known them on a
            personal level and they would not know how talented and capable the
            candidate is unless their submitted documents highlight their
            personality and traits. Below mentioned are some of the key pointers
            you should know while drafting LOR:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>
              A letter of recommendation needs to be comprehensive and precisely
              elucidated. It essentially needs to be concise and resourceful so
              as to provide the reader with insights about the applicant and
              their personality.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              It doesn’t need to be over-embellished because then it would seem
              like the person writing is trying to project an exaggerated image
              of the candidate.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              A LOR must be written with a holistic approach so that as much as
              a candidate’s strengths and achievements are highlighted, their
              weak points must also be discussed thus creating a balance between
              the two.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              It should have a personal touch along with a sense of originality
              because it should not appear to be copied from somewhere
              else.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              It should principally highlight the perspective of the person
              writing it so that the admission committee or the HR department
              gets a gist of the candidate’s personality from someone who has
              known them professionally and to an extent, personally.

            What Should be Written in a Letter of Recommendation?
          </h2>
          <p>
            To help you understand what a letter of recommendation must contain,
            we have created a questionnaire with the help of our head coaches
            that you must take a look at:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p
            className={styles.hasBackground}
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ebf5" }}
          >
            <strong>What is your relationship with the applicant?&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The person writing a letter of recommendation needs to primarily
            elaborate on how they have known the candidate in order to establish
            their credentials and reliability.
          </p>
          <p
            className={styles.hasBackground}
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#bbdcee" }}
          >
            <strong>
              What do you think are the applicant’s monumental achievements that
              highlight their talents and characteristics?&nbsp;
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While answering this question, the referee needs to support their
            reasons with specific instances when the candidate exhibited their
            talents and proved themselves to be worthy despite the hardships
            they faced. Then, the candidate’s strengths can be related to how
            they are suitable for the chosen program or career profile.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p
            className={styles.hasBackground}
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#95c9e5" }}
          >
            <strong>What are the applicant’s major weaknesses?&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Jotting down the weaknesses can be a tricky thing as you need to
            implement a balanced approach as a recommender. For this aspect of a
            letter of recommendation, you can’t mention the negative traits of
            the candidate but mention those things that can still improve. While
            saying that someone works too hard can seem insincere, you can opt
            for a rather mediated style and say that they have a strong work
            ethic.
          </p>
          <p
            className={styles.hasBackground}
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#6cb4db" }}

            <strong>
              To what extent does the applicant elucidate originality and
              independence?&nbsp;
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing a letter of recommendation for someone who has applied for a
            managerial position in a firm or a business administration course,
            the recommender is required to ensure that the candidate has
            prospective qualities and skills for their chosen profile or
            program. Alongside, you have to ensure that you highlight their
            originality of thoughts and how they exhibit a flair of independence
            in their actions. This can be through citing instances or through
            certain personality traits.
          </p>
          <p
            className={styles.hasBackground}
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#409cce" }}
          >
            <strong>
              How will the program/career profile help the applicant realize
              their goals?&nbsp;
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Concluding the letter of recommendation, you need to add an overall
            outline of how the course or the job profile is an opportunity for
            the applicant to grow professionally as well as personally. Connect
            the candidate’s traits with their chosen program or work opportunity
            and highlight the key pointers mentioning how it is a suitable
            choice for them to realize their career goals.

              I fondly remember that during the summer holidays home he prepared
              an extraordinary thesis on the novel prescribed in the syllabus.
              His meticulousness with respect to the topic conveyed his deep
              interest in the domain. During the group presentation of the
              thesis, he showcased special skills in public speaking and
              leadership at an early age. His insights in the conclusion stated
              his command over the language. Analysing all this about Ansh

              him for BA English Honours at the University of Essex.&nbsp;

          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Common Mistakes in LOR </h2>
          <p>
            There are a number of frequent blunders that both recommenders and
            students seeking recommendations must avoid. Here are some pointers
            on how to write a superb LOR while avoiding frequent blunders:
          </p>
          <h3

            Not writing an individualized LOR
          </h3>
          <p>
            Copying and copying a generic LOR from the internet is the easiest
            pitfall to fall into. Not only does this seriously impact your
            chances of an offer letter, but also wastes a golden opportunity to
            showcase your talents and skills.

            Choosing the wrong referee
          </h3>
          <p>
            While getting a LOR from that great, witty professor who taught you
            in your third semester may seem appealing, it is unlikely to help
            you. Your referee must be familiar with you and qualified to write
            your reference.
          </p>
          <h3

          >
            Inability to maintain proper protocol
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your LOR must be typed (not handwritten) and sent in a sealed
            envelope with university letterhead. Otherwise, the veracity of your
            LOR is in doubt.
          </p>
          <h3 id="lack-of-relevant-information">
            Lack of relevant information
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ensures that you provide enough information about yourself to your
            recommender. To assist them in drafting a successful LOR, send them
            your SOP, CV, and any other credentials. Make sure your referee has
            at least a month to complete the letter. After all, hurry work is a
            substandard job.

            Politically incorrect language

          <p>
            Today, one must be extra careful not to offend people’s
            sensibilities. By utilizing specific phrases or words, one may
            accidentally cause harm to others.

            Some of the most frequently asked questions about letters of
            recommendation include:

              <p />
              <p>
                Ans. One of the most significant distinctions between a
                Statement of Purpose and a recommendation letter is that the
                former is written by the candidate, whilst the latter is
                prepared by someone else.

              <p />
              <p className="schema-faq-answer">
                While there is no strict word restriction in the Letter of
                Recommendation style, a word count of 500-600 words is optimal.
                Recommenders should keep their reference letters to one side of
                a single A-4 size sheet unless otherwise instructed.

              <p className="schema-faq-answer">
                Ans. Email or phone calls are the best ways to contact a
                recommender. Ask them nicely and provide them with all the
                information they need, such as submission procedures and
                prerequisites. Also, when requesting a LOR, be sure to include
                any special talents or accomplishments you want them to
                highlight.

                <p />
                <p>
                  Ans. While the majority of students require academic LORs for
                  MS programmes, only a few colleges demand professional LORs.
                  As a result, students must seek the advice of their academic
                  supervisors, instructors, counsellors, and others.
