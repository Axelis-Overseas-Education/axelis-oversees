            To aesthetically present a movie on the screen, great actors are the
            requisites. Similar is the case when one is carving their own career
            path. From choosing the right course to getting into your dream
            university, you need to take each step carefully. As a crucial part
            of the eligibility criteria, the universities often demand LORs,
            SOPs or scores to assess the candidates and their suitability for
            the chosen course. A Statement of Purpose (SOP) is one such element
            that beholds great value in the admission process of those aspiring
            to study abroad. Creating an alluring SOP is essential to help the
            assessment committee understand your willingness for the program you
            have applied for. This blog aims to provide a comprehensive
            step-by-step guide on drafting a statement of purpose that can help
            you sail smoothly through the assessment process and get entry into
            your dream academic institution.

            What is a Statement of Purpose (SOP)?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A Statement of Purpose can be referred to as an informative
            document, containing personal statements, and is essentially
            required as part of the admission procedure of study abroad
            programs. Also referred to as an application essay, it comprises the
            basic details of a candidate along with their professional and
            personal interests, academic highlights as well as future
            aspirations. An SOP plays an integral role in the application
            process of a study abroad program as it provides the admission board
            with the key information about the candidate and why they want to
            study a particular course at their institution. It not only
            describes who you are as an individual but also gives an idea about
            your writing skills and proficiency in the English language.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Why is SOP important?</h2>
          <p>
            A well-written SOP is an extremely significant element during your
            admission process. While the academic record and other exam
            scorecards, academic transcripts and backlog certificates are
            essentially objective in nature, an SOP is the only truly subjective
            aspect of your application. It is the only document in your
            application that gives you the opportunity to prove that you have
            something unique which makes you stand out from the crowd. As such,
            it is the document of your application docket that can hugely
            determine your admission.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>SOP Format</h2>
          <p>
            As such, there is no particular or proper format for writing a
            statement of purpose or an SOP. Students have to write an SOP just
            like an elaborative and descriptive English essay dividing the whole
            context into different paragraphs. Each paragraph must be having
            distinctive features describing different scenarios, features or
            characteristics about yourself. You can take the help of the
            below-provided structure and get started with writing an SOP for the
            university you want to study in.

            How to Write a Statement of Purpose?
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a pivotal document for any study abroad application, an SOP needs
            to be precisely well-written. To help you understand the different
            elements of this document, we have curated a step-by-step procedure
            that you can follow to curate an impressive statement of purpose.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>
            <span id="1-ponder">1. Ponder</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first step of the process of drafting a statement of purpose is
            to think about the varied aspects of your candidature that you
            should mention in it. The mandatory inclusions of an SOP are
            academic achievements (especially at the undergraduate level), prior
            work exposure or volunteering experiences. Start with framing an
            outline for the document and ask yourself the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>Which field of study excites me the most?</li>
            <li>Why do I want to pursue this degree?</li>
            <li>What are my expectations from this degree?</li>
            <li>What outgrowth can this degree offer me?</li>
            <li>
              Where can this degree take me, personally and
              professionally?&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Through my pre-requisites, what values can I add to this program?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once you have made key pointers for most of the questions mentioned
            above, you can begin jotting them down in a thorough and
            comprehensive manner.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>
            <span id="2-formulate">2. Formulate</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Now that you know what you want to mention in your SOP, it’s time to
            curate a rough outline for the document. Here is a list of some
            essential tips you need to keep in mind while formulating your
            statement of purpose:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>
              Since the admission committee strives to understand your
              candidature through the SOP, you need to be honest in describing
              your career aspirations and objectives. Focus centrally on
              maintaining the authenticity of your mentioned details. Duly
              elaborate on your advantageous perception of the chosen course.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creatively cite your personal and professional interests. Mention
              what you are passionate about and what excites you. Then, sensibly
              connect it with your chosen program and how it will assist you in
              grooming your skills. For instance, you can state that you are
              aspiring to gain experiential learning or training in your desired
              industry through the course.
            </li>
            <li>
              What brought you here should be a sure-shot mention in your SOP.
              You can begin with stating those features of your chosen course
              that convinced you to opt for it. Then, write down the objectives
              you want to fulfil by studying the program. It can be personal
              growth or professional upliftment or even both. Try to be unique
              and precise when listing your reasons.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

            <span id="3-revise-and-modify">3. Revise and Modify</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once you have jotted down your SOP as per the above-mentioned
            necessary tips, the final and concluding step is to revise and make
            changes accordingly. Go through the list that you created in the
            beginning and ensure that you have added all of them.

            <li>
              The word limit for a statement of purpose is between

            </li>
            <li>
              Do not miss out the predefined sizes for spacing, margins and font

            Many foreign and even national universities ask for a Statement of
            Purpose (SOP) from candidates wanting to enrol in suitable courses
            that the university has to offer. They ask for the SOP from
            candidates in order to check and look at the following things:

            How to Write a powerful and convincing SOP?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Whether applying for undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate
            programmes, the strategy of writing a powerful statement of purpose
            should be sound focused throughout. Starting from your academic and
            professional background to your career aspirations, you need to
            carefully connect all the dots between reaching your goals through
            your choice of school and course. The essay should always go in a
            flow covering your past experience, present involvements, and future
            plans. An important point to remember while writing your SOP would
            be to divide it into paragraphs that cover all the pointers. Here is
            a look at how you may write the SOP presenting your profile
            strongly:
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.heading2}>
            <span id="introduction">Introduction</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            This paragraph is often confused with self-introduction. It should
            not introduce you but should discuss what you are about to discuss
            in your SOP. There are multiple approaches you may adopt to go about
            this paragraph:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>
              Discuss your long-term goal and connect it with your idea of
              pursuing the course you are applying to
            </li>
            <li>
              Present&nbsp;your understanding of the chosen field and write how
              you want to contribute to that field
            </li>
            <li>
              Explain your background in&nbsp;2-3&nbsp;lines and connect it with
              your future goals
            </li>
            <li>
              Write about an anecdote that helped you realise your professional
              interest in the chosen field
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>
            <span id="academic-background-and-professional-experience">
              Academic Background and Professional Experience
            </span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This comprises of your academic background: what you have done so
            far, what you are currently pursuing, your academic strengths and
            projects, and the industrial exposure you have attained.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>
            <span id="career-goals">Career Goals</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is the most important paragraph, where you should&nbsp;discuss
            your short and long-term goals. Your immediate goal would be where
            you would want to work right after completing this course. You
            should be able to name some companies within India along with the
            designation you see yourself working at. This should explain the
            kind of job profile you would be working on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then comes your long-term goal, wherein you should mention where you
            see yourself from 10-12 or 15 years down the line. This may include
            your desire of working at the CEO/CFO/CTO level or maybe establish a
            firm that you own. It may also include your dream of expanding your
            existing family business overseas. You may also be interested in
            further studies like a PhD which can be included here.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            More in this section may include your desire of becoming a professor
            or researcher. In any case, it is suggested that you discuss your

            How Long Should an SOP be?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Ideally, if considering an internationally renowned university, then
            the statement of purpose should be at least 1-2 pages long. In terms
            of word count, then the same should be around 1000 words. Having
            said that, the word limit and the length may also sometimes depend
            on the university that the candidate is targeting and also on the
            level of degree. Like for example, a candidate who is writing an SOP
            for an undergraduate program may not exceed 800 to 1000 words
            whereas a candidate who is writing an SOP for a PhD or M.Phil degree
            course has to write it in around 1200 words and sometimes even more.
            Some universities even have a fixed length and word count which is
            uniform for all the programs and courses.&nbsp;

              What to include in an SOP?
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are many elements to an SOP. Universities could ask
            question-based essays or simply a general statement of purpose.
            Until and unless categorically asked, an SOP must include your goals
            and the career path you have taken up so far as well as your
            academic progress. Other elements that are further important to the
            SOP are also the personal motivations that&nbsp;lead you to choose
            the university/course you have applied to as well as how you intend
            to use that experience to achieve that goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following are a few things that you must do in order to make your
            SOP application strong:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>
              Your Statement of Purpose should have a unique and engaging
              beginning as well as an end. It must be original, a reflection of
              you.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Explain your academic background, present and future aspirations.
              Through this, you must justify your choice of a particular course
              for masters or doctorate courses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon reading your SOP, the admission officer should be able to
              understand how you can contribute to the university in terms of
              research and further scope in your chosen area.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Always write your SOP in an active voice and ensure you provide
              information in a manner that is a reflection of your passion and
              optimism. If you have any statements or references, try quoting
              them with relevant examples rather than being direct.
            </li>
          </ul>

              What not to include in an SOP?
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Often universities come across a lengthy statement of purpose and
            yet they reject it. Even when you cannot find one grammatical error,
            the seemingly excellent SOP would be rejected. And the primary
            reason is – too much unnecessary information. For instance, just
            because you might want to talk about your family, does not mean you
            go on and on to talk about only your family.&nbsp;While your SOP
            should be a brag sheet, it should be a brag sheet with a substance.
            You need to pick and choose what to include. Pick a theme and
            mention the accomplishments that make the most sense to your
            candidacy.

              Proofread, edit, re-edit and then edit it again! There is always

              <strong>“</strong>A successful career in Business Management
              requires adequate knowledge to utilise the strengths and
              weaknesses of an individual. In my undergraduate degree, I majored
              in economics and psychology because I believe that understanding
              these two fields is important for leading a successful business. I
              want to increase my experiences and knowledge further by pursuing
              an Executive MBA, which will equip me with advanced skills that
              are necessary to achieve my career goals.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As I have carried out various leadership positions, I have learned
              how to efficiently work in teams and pursue the specified goals.
              In my previous company, ABC, I successfully implemented the
              strength-cum-weakness finder software which helped us assign
              projects to the groups based on the mapped data. As employees got
              allotted tasks as per their efficiency, it resulted in a 30% net
              gain for the company over the following year. I believe that a
              successful business leader understands the importance of
              strategically utilizing a company’s resources to ensure the
              maximum potential and development of the company. Further, the
              pivotal thing I learned about myself by taking up leadership roles
              is that teamwork is a crucial element of successfully achieving an
              organisation’s objectives. An Executive MBA will help me furnish
              my leadership skills imparting me with the knowledge of
              hierarchical structures and how to work with other leaders of
              different domains in an effective manner.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Studying for an Executive MBA, I plan to take charge of multiple
              team projects throughout the duration of the degree so that I can
              polish my teamwork skills. I aspire to work under industry leaders
              and attain global exposure. Pursuing this degree from your
              institution, I aim to gain professional as well as personal skills
              that can help me soar through my career journey.<strong>”</strong>

            I had a keen interest in Biology since childhood. I was eager to
            learn about the living organisms around my surroundings and how they
            function. I took this interest forward and decided to pursue my
            higher education in biology. When I was first introduced to the
            field of biotechnology, I was mesmerized by what technology can do
            to improve the life of any living organism. This inspired me to look
            at various research programmes in biotechnology and how we are
            moving towards a phase where technology can alter even the basic
            fragments of any living organism and change the course of life an
            organism goes through. I observed the various research patterns that
            have been taking place in the agricultural industry with the advent
            of GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) giving birth to the Green
            Revolution. This was only one potential achievement in the extensive
            list of achievements that biotechnology was progressing
            towards.&nbsp;I worked with a reputed biotech firm which gave me an
            insight into how fast-paced the research in biotechnology is. The
            firm gave me the necessary exposure leading me to decide that I want
            to pursue MS in Biotechnology. My ambition to work in this field
            lies essentially in bringing changes in the lifestyle of people in a
            way that I can research and extensively study the required positive
            steps towards climate change. My goal is to achieve a sustainable
            lifestyle for every individual. The exposure that your esteemed
            institution will give me in the field of research will help me
            achieve this goal by working at a reputed platform

          <ol className={styles.listStyle}>
            <li>
              Writing the SOP at the last moment without any plan of action or a

            <li>Writing a weak and vague introduction and conclusion&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Using informal language, slangs, short forms in your SOP</li>
            <li>
              Exceeding the word limit and not reaching the correct word limit
              at all

          <p>
            If you are eligible for any college-specific scholarships, then
            during the application process you will be required to write a
            separate essay/SOP. Either you will be given an essay
            prompt/question along with a word limit or they would simply ask for
            an SOP stating the reasons why you think you deserve this
            scholarship and/or what makes you unique from the rest of the
            candidates? Thus, a generic SOP is different from a scholarship SOP.

          <p>
            A Letter of Motivation is a letter directly addressed to the
            admission committee/department faculty explaining your objectives,
            motivation and goals related to the course. The SOP is not addressed
            to any specific person or department, it is drafted in an essay
            format, whereas, the motivational letter is always addressed to a
            professor or department under whose guidance you will be studying.

            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Very much similar to an SOP, Personal Statements are an on-page
            essay where you write about your motivation, inspiration, goals, and
            achievements. Personal Statements usually have a more intimate tone
            than SOP as it talks about the highlighted incidents of your life.
            Another crucial difference between an SOP and a Personal Statement
            is that an SOP is addressed to no one in particular, while a
            Personal Statement is addressed to a professor or department under
            who you choose to study.

            <p>
              Only your LORs need to be attested by your college or company. An
              SOP need not be attested/self-attested until and unless specified
              by the university. If you take a LOR from your college
              professor/school teacher or a Principal/Dean, then that LOR needs
              to be signed by the recommender along with the college/school
              stamp and letterhead. Similarly, for professional LORs, they need
              to be signed by their respective recommenders on the company’s
              letterhead and company stamp.

            <strong>How do I polish my SOP?</strong>
            <p />
            <p>
              Once you have finalised your SOP draft, give it a double-check for
              grammatical and formatting mistakes. Your next step should be to
              analyse and critique your essay. Look at your SOP through the eyes
              of the Adcom and see what you find lacking. For more effective
              inputs, you can show your drafts to your friends and family and
              see how they react to them. Accordingly, you can make some changes
              but do not overdo it or deviate from the format. Lastly, check for
              spacing errors and save the final SOP which you will be using for
              the application process.

            </strong>
            <p />
            <p>
              You should avoid mentioning any low marks or shortcomings about
              yourself in any of the application documents, including SOP. There
              are very few universities that ask you about your gap year. For
              them, you can mention the reason for the gap between your studies.
              Generally, no university asks about low grades during your study
              period as your selection depends on various criteria like exam
              scores, student profile, financials, and so on. Thus, it is
              advised against mentioning any flaws or low marks.
